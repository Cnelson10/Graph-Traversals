Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search of a graph and Dijkstra's Algorithm for a weighted graph

Abstract
In this lab you get setup to work with graphs.
Create a Graph class to store nodes and edges or download a Graph library
such as JUNG. Use it to implement Breadth First Search and Depth First Search
Follow the video from class if you need a reference.

Add a method to your previous assignment which performs Dijkstra's algorithm from a given
starting node. It should return a Map containing the shortest distances to each node.

You may need to make your own edge class as described in the tutorial to handle weights.
